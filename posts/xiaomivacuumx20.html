          <h2>Performance</h2>
          <p>The X20 Pro offers powerful suction and intelligent navigation, suitable for medium to large UAE apartments. The combined mop system works best for light spills and maintenance rather than deep-floor scrubbing.</p>
        <section>
          <h2>Price & Availability</h2>
          <p>GadgetsUAE listed price: <strong>AED 1,098.00</strong>. Compare local retailers for warranty and after-sales support.</p>
        </section>
          <p>Recommended for busy households that want automated cleaning with minimal intervention. Consider maintenance costs and filter replacements when budgeting.</p>

          <h2>Practical Notes</h2>
          <p>For homes with pets or long-pile rugs, expect to clean the brush and filter more often — the X20's power helps, but maintenance is key to keep suction optimal.</p>
          <p>Its mapping is reliable in open-plan apartments; in cluttered rooms, run a couple of mapping cycles so the robot learns optimal routes.</p>
